### TODO list 
- [ ] test blocks of inhibition (200 um)
- [ ] test electrical connections between inhibitory cells to inhibtion motif
- [ ] Hypothesis testing on pattern separation (reject, accept null hypothese)
- [ ] Inhibitory microcircuit generate GC network sparness (reject, accept null hypothese)
- [ ] Proper activation of IN network upon sparse GC activity (reject, accept null hypotese)
- [ ] configure Travis CI for unittesting
- [ ] Add conting GC-GC connections @ClaudiaEsp
- [ ] add rsa key to repository (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8588768/git-push-username-password-how-to-avoid)
- [ ] add description and topics to repository @ClaudiaEsp
- [ ] add Alois to check repository
